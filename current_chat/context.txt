Based on the documentation, to create an endpoint in your Bubble app for creating or updating records, you should start with Bubble's Data API.

Here is a basic guide to get you started:

1. Enable the Data API in Bubble
First, you need to enable the Data API and expose the specific data types you want to work with.

In your Bubble editor, navigate to Settings > API.
Check the box for Enable Data API.
Once enabled, a list of your app's data types will appear. Check the box next to the data type you want to create or update records for (e.g., User, Product).
2. Get Your API Token for Authentication
To test the connection, the simplest method is to use a private API key which grants admin-level access.

In the same Settings > API tab, scroll down to the API Keys section.
Generate a new Private key. Give it a descriptive name.
Copy this key. You will use it as a "Bearer token" to authenticate your requests.
Important: Keep this key secret, as it provides full access to your app's data.

3. Test the Connection
You can now send a request from an API tool like Postman or using curl to test the connection. The goal is to create a new record.

The endpoint URL to create a new object of a certain type is: POST https://<your-app-domain>/api/1.1/obj/<type-name>

Replace <your-app-domain> with your app's domain (e.g., yourapp.bubbleapps.io) and <type-name> with the name of the data type you exposed.

Here is an example using curl to create a new record in a type called item with a field named name:

curl -X POST "https://<your-app-domain>/api/1.1/obj/item" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your-api-token>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "name": "My Test Item"
}'

If successful, the API will respond with a 201 Created status and the unique ID of the new record.

Next Steps: Updating a Record
To update a record, you will make a PATCH or PUT request to the same endpoint, but you'll append the unique ID of the record you want to change.

PATCH https://<your-app-domain>/api/1.1/obj/<type-name>/<record-id>
