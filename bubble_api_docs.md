# Authentication

{% hint style="info" %}
**Authentication** is the process of identifying **who** a client[^1] is in order to determine what resources[^2] they have access to your your application.
{% endhint %}

## Introduction

Both the [Data API](#user-content-fn-3)[^3] and the [Workflow API](#user-content-fn-4)[^4] can be set up to require the client to authenticate themselves in order for your app to determine what resources they are allowed to access. In simpler words, you can require all external systems that want to access your database and workflows to log in using a secret password.

<figure><img src="https://34394582-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FRuxi0Oh5kFl4JzgmVGEY%2Fauthentication-bubble.jpeg?alt=media&#x26;token=2108a28a-f76c-42aa-87f8-6c0018441c88" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The article in the link below explains how the [_bearer token_](#user-content-fn-5)[^5] is used to authenticate a client, regardless of the method you choose (except if you use no authentication).

{% content-ref url="authentication/how-to-authenticate" %}
[how-to-authenticate](authentication/how-to-authenticate)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Authentication methods

There are three different levels of authentication that you can set up in Bubble, each with their own pros/cons and security ramifications.

The articles below outline the three different authentication methods you can use:

{% content-ref url="authentication/no-authentication" %}
[no-authentication](authentication/no-authentication)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="authentication/as-a-user" %}
[as-a-user](authentication/as-a-user)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="authentication/as-an-admin" %}
[as-an-admin](authentication/as-an-admin)
{% endcontent-ref %}



[^1]: The _client_ is the system that initiates an API Connection by sending a request, as opposed to the _server_ who is the one to receive it and respond.

[^2]: An API resource is a specific item or service that is made available by the API and can be accessed via a unique endpoint.\
    \
    This can be a data type such as _Users_ or a specific API Workflow.\
    \
    Article section: [What are resources?](../../introduction-to-apis#resource)

[^3]: The Data API can give external applications access to your app's database to read, create, edit and delete records.\
    \
    Article: [The Data API](the-data-api)\
    Reference: [The Data API](../../../../core-resources/api/the-bubble-api/the-data-api)

[^4]: The Workflow API lets you set up API workflows that can be triggered from outside of your own application without visiting any page.\
    \
    Article: [The Workflow API](the-workflow-api)\
    Reference: [The Workflow API](../../../../core-resources/api/the-bubble-api/the-workflow-api)

description: >-
  This section covers how to set up incoming API connections that don't require
  any authentication.
---

# No authentication

The most basic way is to require no authentication at all. This means that any internet user who knows about your app’s API can connect and make any change they want to all the data types you have exposed in the Data API setting.

While there are scenarios where this may be what you want, you should generally be very careful with this option. Keep in mind that API calls will consume your app’s capacity just like any other operation, so even if you set up an open API intentionally, you will need to consider that a high volume of calls may end up consuming a large portion of your server capacity.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Don’t be tempted to think that your API is secure because no one knows its URL endpoints. The endpoints are easy to construct with just a tiny bit of information. \
\
**Obfuscation is not security**: to keep your API truly secure you need proper authentication.
{% endhint %}

## The Data API

To offer access to the Data API without authentication, the following settings need to be set up:

1. Activate the Data API under Settings - API
2. Activate the Data Types that you want to expose
3. Set up a Privacy Rule on each of the data types where you check all the boxes in the Everyone Else rule, including Create via API, Modify via API and Delete via API

---

---
description: >-
  This section covers how to authenticate an API client as a user logged in to
  your application, allowing you to protect your data with Privacy Rules
---

# As a User

## What is User authentication?

**User authentication** means that the client[^1] making the request is authenticating as a User, which means that we can determine what they are authorized to access using [Privacy Rules](#user-content-fn-2)[^2], just like our regular app Users.

This is the method that offers the highest level of security and flexibility since it allows you to provide different Privacy Rules based on who the client is.

## How to set up User authentication

In principle, logging a client in as a User happens in the same way that you log in a regular User in your app, except that the action needs to happens in an [API Workflow](#user-content-fn-3)[^3]. When you log in a User, Bubble can return a token that can be used to authenticate in subsequent calls.

1. Create an API Workflow with a fitting name such as _generate-api-token_
2. Use the _Log the User in_ action or _Sign the user up_ action to log in or create a new User. For the _Log the User in_ action you will need to provide an email and a password.
3. If successful, Bubble will automatically respond with a token that can be used as a Bearer token in subsequent call.

<figure><img src="https://34394582-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FGuNtm4OtlrhYupIL82MG%2Fgenerate-user-token-api-workflow%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=6d1a3cd2-c62f-489d-9643-263da6bbd083" alt=""><figcaption><p>If you log a user in with an action in an API Workflow, Bubble will respond with a token that can be used to authenticate the client in subsequent requests. In the example above we are accepting the email and password as parameters in the API Workflow.</p></figcaption></figure>

## How long is the token valid?

The token has to different validities depending on your settings.

### Without 2-factor authentication

* If you set _Keep the user logged in_ to "yes", the token has a validity of **12 months**
* If you set _Keep the user logged in_ to "no", the token has a validity of **24 hours**

### **With 2-factor authentication**

* If you set _Keep the user logged in_ to "yes", the token has a validity of **1 month**
* If you set _Keep the user logged in_ to "no", the token has a validity of **24 hours**

### Revoking a token

There are two ways to revoke a token after it has been generated:

* You can call a _Log the User out_ action from the client that uses the relevant token
* You can use the _Log out other user's sessions_ to sign a User out from every session except for the one they are running the workflow from

## Restricting a client's privileges

There are two ways to restrict the access level and privileges of a client that's using a user token:

* **Privacy Rules:** your main level of protection is setting up privacy rules that match the User that is signed in and control their access to find, read, create, edit and delete data through the API.&#x20;
* **Conditions**: on API Workflows you can set up Conditions that restrict the triggering of the workflow based on fields saved on the User. This will apply to clients who are sending a request with a user authentication token.

# How to authenticate

{% hint style="info" %}
This section covers what kind of authentication method you can use when you are making an **incoming request** to to your Bubble application from an external app.

\
If you are looking for how to authenticate **outgoing requests** sent via the API Connector, check out [this article](../../the-api-connector/authentication).
{% endhint %}

## Bubble's authentication method

There are many different ways to authenticate[^1] an API request. Bubble uses the method known as  _**bearer token**_.

### What is a bearer token?

The bearer token is a string that identifies **who** the client is. It serves as both username and password and is included in the _header_ of the API request. Tokens are generated by Bubble by creating an [admin API key](#user-content-fn-2)[^2] or by [signing a User in through an API call](#user-content-fn-3)[^3].&#x20;

Since every [RESTful API ](#user-content-fn-4)[^4]request is made independently of any previous or later requests, the token needs to be included with every API request coming into your app that requires authentication.

## Authenticate with a bearer token in Postman

The bearer token needs to be included in the Authorization header of an HTTP request, in the following format:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

In the example above, \<token> represents the actual token string. Do not include "<" and ">" in the final string.

In an application like Postman[^5], the authorization should look like this:

<figure><img src="https://34394582-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FmBOFnFHFtwsstC9BdIpL%2Fbearer-token-postman.png?alt=media&#x26;token=2d65c39a-3dfd-4c15-9834-8233b822e661" alt=""><figcaption><p>The top row in the request header carries the bearer token. It is greyed out because it has been added in the <em>Authorization</em> tab (left of the <em>Headers</em> tab) and Postman automatically adds it to the header.</p></figcaption></figure>

When included like in the above illustration, Bubble will recognize the token and respond to the call according to the privileges (if any) of the User that the token represents.

<details>

<summary>How secure are API bearer tokens?</summary>

Bearer tokens are considered more secure than sending a username and password in each request because they can be easily revoked, have a limited lifetime and can be connected to one of your app's Users which allows you to limit the scope of their database and workflow access by use of [Privacy Rules](#user-content-fn-6)[^6] and Conditions[^7].

Additionally, bearer tokens can be easily revoked if the user's device is lost or stolen, whereas revoking a password would require the user to reset it on all devices. Additionally, tokens are sent in the headers, which are less prone to being intercepted than cookies or URL parameters.\
\
Tokens generated by Bubble are considered [cryptographically secure](#user-content-fn-8)[^8], meaning they cannot be easily reconstructed and have a length of 32 bytes.\

    \

[^4]: A RESTful API is a way to describe that an API follows a certain kind of structure that ensures it is compatible with other services that share the same structure.\
    \
    Bubble's API is built around these principles to offer the broadest level of compatability.\

[^6]: Privacy Rules are server-side rules that govern **who** has access to **what** in your database. For example, a logged-in User may have access to specific Data Types while a non-logged-in User does not.\
    \
    In the context of API requests, Privacy Rules apply to **clients** that have authenticated using a **User token**.



    Article: [Privacy Rules](broken-reference)

[^7]: Conditions on a Workflow let you specify under which condition the Workflow should run.\
    \
    For example, a logged-in User may be able to run a workflow, but a non-logged-in User may not.\
    \
    In the context of APIs, Conditions can be applied depending on who the **client** is.&#x20;

[^8]: The field of encryption is called _cryptography._ Cryptographically secure means that the token is generated in a way that the industry considers highly secure.\
    \
    This is done using complex algorithms that ensure a level of randomness that is extremely difficult to recreate.\
    \
    In the case of Bubble's tokens, their length of 32 bytes also dramatically increases the computational power that would be required to crack it.

# The Data API

The Data API is Bubble’s automated way of providing external systems access to your app’s database. It allows one-click creation of a RESTful[^1] interface to some or all of your application's data. You can let a client read, modify, and delete individual data items, search for data using a flexible query language, and create and bulk upload new things

You can grant [full admin access](#user-content-fn-2)[^2] to the database and allow another system to be able to freely make changes (even in bulk) or you can exert [exact contro](#user-content-fn-3)[^3]l over what data types they can access and what kind of actions they can take. Since the Data API in theory can give any external system complete control over your database, it’s important to learn how to set it up in a secure way.&#x20;

Remember that Bubble offers strong security, but we don’t enforce it – because we want to allow flexibility you are free to set up your Data API to be as open or closed as you prefer. This is why it’s important to learn how different decisions affect security so you can make informed decisions that suit your project.

## **Activating the Data API**

You’ll find the Data API by navigating to Settings - API. To make sure that no one can access your database unless you want them to, the Data API is disabled by default. To enable it, check the Enable Data API checkbox.

<figure><img src="https://34394582-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FvYr0YmnkuI8Wfm1iWTwa%2Factivate-data-api.png?alt=media&#x26;token=02543942-91ef-46d2-9146-059c70891fb7" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

As soon as you have the Data API enabled, you’ll see a list of all your data types along with a second checkbox: this is where you select which data types to expose in the API

{% hint style="danger" %}
Only activate the Data Types that you want to expose in the Data API.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Keep in mind the following:

* Unchecked data types are **not** available in the Data API regardless of how the user authenticates
* Checked data types are exposed, but adhere to the privacy rules in combination with the client’s authentication

  This section covers how to use API workflows to allow external applications to
  execute workflows in your Bubble app.

# The Workflow API

## **What is the Workflow API?**

The Workflow API is the part of Bubble's [built-in API](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] that lets you set up workflows that can be triggered from an external application or system by sending an API request or by scheduling an API workflow in your app.

By constructing [API Workflows](#user-content-fn-2)[^2] just like you construct regular workflows on a page, you can make Bubble perform any kind of action or sequence of actions based on a request that can include parameters.

For example, let's imagine you have a customer contact form on a website that's not part of your Bubble application. By sending an API request from that platform that includes parameters like name, email and phone number, you can use an API Workflow to create a new lead or register a new user in your Bubble app.

API Workflows also lets your app respond to webhooks[^3] in other systems. For example, whenever a payment is made successfully in Stripe, you can set up a webhook in Stripe to trigger a workflow in your Bubble app so that any needed action can be taken immediately.

### What's the difference between API Workflows and Backend Workflows?

As you start working in the Backend Workflow section of Bubble you may find the two terms used in different contexts. While they are certainly related, they don't carry the exact same meaning:

* **Backend Workflows** encompass all the different events that you can add in the Backend Workflow editor:
  * API Workflows
  * Backend Triggers
  * Recurring Events
  * Custom Events
* **API Workflows** refer specifically to the Workflows that you add by using the _New API Workflow_ command in the editor. They are referred to as API Workflows whether they are public[^4] or not.

<figure><img src="https://34394582-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F41GtHrybmGkkfa48Kk8f%2Fbackend-workflows.png?alt=media&#x26;token=d48a14e2-6864-4d81-9c91-3602d7d6d431" alt=""><figcaption><p>Backend Workflows is a collective term for all the different events you can create in the Backend Editor.</p></figcaption></figure>

## **Activating the Workflow API**

To activate API Workflows, go to Settings - API and check the _Enable Workflow API and Backend Workflow_. This exposes all workflows that have _Expose as a public workflow_ checked.

This also reveals your application's Workflow API root URL.

<figure><img src="https://34394582-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FfHlMmESlz4YRLlVllWiM%2Fenable-workflow-api-bubble.png?alt=media&#x26;token=5f0db313-e018-4234-bf11-d4321ea6aded" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## **Accessing the backend workflow editor**

When the Workflow API has been enabled in your application’s settings, you can navigate to the virtual page _Backend workflows_ by clicking the icon in the left-hand menu bar.

# The API Connector

In the [Bubble API section](the-bubble-api) we covered API requests that are incoming – they are initiated by an outside system and Bubble takes some kind of action based on their credentials, endpoint and parameters.

{% hint style="info" %}
This is our in-depth manual article on the API Connector.\
\
If you are familiar with APIs and want the shorter technical reference go to the [API Connector reference entry](../../../core-resources/api/the-api-connector). We also have a dedicated article covering [API Connector security](../../security/api-security/api-connector-security).
{% endhint %}

In this section we’ll look at requests that are **outbound** – when your Bubble app sends a request to an external system. When you use the API Connector, your Bubble app is the _client_ and the API service is the _server_.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can read more about the client/server relationship in our [Introduction to APIs](introduction-to-apis).\
\
Article section: [The client/server relationship](../introduction-to-apis#client-and-server)
{% endhint %}



<figure><img src="https://34394582-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2Fa4uqiDqJuz4vjLjfPW5B%2Foutgoing-api-call.jpeg?alt=media&#x26;token=b715ebac-1632-4dc1-bbe9-e46597584246" alt=""><figcaption><p>The API Connector handles calls that come <em><strong>from</strong></em> your Bubble app <em><strong>to</strong></em> another application.</p></figcaption></figure>



By pointing the API Connector to different URLs (Universal Resource Locator) you can access specific resources[^1] that the API provider offers.

Just like incoming requests these calls can ask for some data to be returned or for an action to be performed.

Structurally, you’ll recognize what they look like: they also use an [HTTP request](#user-content-fn-2)[^2] that includes a method[^3] like GET, POST, PATCH and DELETE.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Plugins:** Bubble's plugin store offers thousands of plugins both made by Bubble and the community. Many plugins let you connect to well-known API services quickly and effortlessly without having to set it up in the API Connector.\
\
Link: [Plugin store](https://bubble.io/plugins)\
Article: [Plugins that connect to APIs](plugins-that-connect-to-apis)
{% endhint %}

## The API Connector

The API Connector is a special plugin built by Bubble's development team that lets you connect to any service that exposes a JSON-based[^4], [RESTful web API](#user-content-fn-5)[^5]. You can use this to add API calls to fetch data from an external service, or post data to trigger some actions on the service's end.

Our long-form video course gives you an introduction to how APIs work and how to use the API Connector.
{% endembed %}

### **Installing the API Connector**

The API Connector is a plugin created by Bubble and needs to be installed in your application before it can be used.

To install the plugin:

1. Navigate to the _Plugins_ section of the Bubble editor and click _Add plugin_.
2. Search for _API Connector_
3. Click the _Install_ button

<figure><img src="https://34394582-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F1fdizjb0dOUpZWUwyefs%2Fapi-connector-plugin-install%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=fe200852-fb4f-4b4e-bb85-b2ae94b531c6" alt=""><figcaption><p>Click the Install button to use the API Connector in your application.</p></figcaption></figure>

## **External API documentation**

Every API service is different and to make it possible to connect successfully to their platform, most providers offer API documentation. Using the external documentation is critical to understand how to authenticate and make calls to that specific service, so we recommend you get to know it before you start.

<figure><img src="https://34394582-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FLfIOXaYMOBmsmk5DcDP8%2Fstripe-documentation.png?alt=media&#x26;token=56c60a40-c75a-4d8c-b35e-5c0e8caf2a44" alt=""><figcaption><p>API providers like Stripe offer detailed <a href="https://stripe.com/docs">documentation</a> on how to set up API connections.</p></figcaption></figure>

If this is your first time working with APIs, the documentation may seem fairly technical at first, but you’ll find that with the RESTful API style most providers follow a similar standard.

Most APIs will go through three steps before they can be used:

1. First set up the [**authentication**](#user-content-fn-6)[^6] for the API service
2. Secondly we set up the different [**call**](#user-content-fn-7)[^7]\(s) we want to use
3. Then we [**initialize**](#user-content-fn-8)[^8] the call to make sure it works and to see the server's response

### Test accounts

Many API providers such as Stripe offer a demo account that you can use to test your API calls without making any actual changes (or payments in the case of Stripe). Check whether the service you want to connect to offers this kind of testing environment to be able to properly test all your calls with no risk.

## **Naming API providers**

The first part of setting up a new API request is to give the service a name. This will typically be a descriptive name (often the same as the provider’s name) such as Stripe, Google Cloud and OpenWeatherAPI.

<figure><img src="https://34394582-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F5X3y6qxbwEigVt1mc4Jz%2Fapi-name-bubble.png?alt=media&#x26;token=e1933dc6-67df-4130-a7ca-db2708f2ee27" alt=""><figcaption><p>Giving your API a descriptive name makes it easier to organize the different providers.</p></figcaption></figure>

The name is used around the Bubble editor to organize the different calls that we’ll add later. It’s therefore a good idea to use a name that makes the relevant call easy to find later.

{% hint style="danger" %}
The API name becomes part of your application’s client-side code and should not contain any sensitive information.
{% endhint %}

## **Authentication**

As we covered in our general guide on how APIs work, many API services will require authentication[^9]. This is the process of identifying **who** the client is in order to determine what resources it should have access to.

### Authentication methods

There are many different ways to authenticate. Most API providers will have documentation available online that specifies their authentication method and many require you to generate a unique API token.

{% hint style="info" %}
The list below represents the most common authentication types. You can read more about each type in the article below:\
\
Article: [Authenticating with the API Connector](the-api-connector/authentication)
{% endhint %}

<table><thead><tr><th width="259">Method</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>None or self-handled</td><td>No authentication required.<br><mark style="color:orange;">⚠️ (see security note</mark> <a href="#security-risk-with-api-connector-configuration"><mark style="color:orange;">below</mark></a><mark style="color:orange;">)</mark></td></tr><tr><td>Private key in URL</td><td>The private key is included as a parameter in the URL.</td></tr><tr><td>Private key in header</td><td>The private key is included as an HTTP header in the request.</td></tr><tr><td>HTTP Basic Auth</td><td>The client sends username and password in plain text.</td></tr><tr><td>OAuth2 Password Flow</td><td>The client sends username and password and receives an access token in return.</td></tr><tr><td>OAuth2 User-Agent Flow</td><td>Similar to OAuth2 Password Flow, but for user-agents.<br><mark style="color:orange;">⚠️ (see security note</mark> <a href="#security-risk-with-api-connector-configuration"><mark style="color:orange;">below</mark></a><mark style="color:orange;">)</mark></td></tr><tr><td>OAuth2 Custom Token</td><td>The client sends a custom token to the server for verification.</td></tr><tr><td>JSON Web Token (JWT)</td><td>The client sends a JSON web token to the server for verification.</td></tr><tr><td>Client-side SSL certificate</td><td>The client presents a SSL certificate to the server for verification.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<details>

<summary><mark style="color:orange;">⚠️</mark> Privacy considerations when using the API Connector as data</summary>

#### Scenario

When configuring API calls in the API Connector as Data (i.e. “Use as: Data”\
<img src="https://34394582-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FOp3eddrEXCKPZlOTMsDf%2FCleanShot%202025-04-10%20at%2018.15.29%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=ad6441a5-9dd2-4a8c-8b57-1ae0c23f734a" alt="" data-size="line"> ) there is a potential security risk if the Authentication method is set to either:

* `None or self-handled`
* `OAuth2 User-Agent Flow`

…and the API relies on private keys or other sensitive parameters passed as query strings or body parameters.

#### Behavior to be aware of:

In these configurations, Bubble does not enforce privacy rules or validate these requests against the current database state. As a result, sensitive data may be exposed or become accessible to users who should not have access. We suggest the configuration below to ensure stronger control over access.

**Recommended solution:**\
To mitigate this risk, do not only pass private keys as parameters. Instead, use the `Private key in header` authentication method in the API Connector. This ensures:

* The key is securely stored and only sent from the server.
* Bubble’s server-side logic handles the call and can enforce privacy rules.

</details>

### **API tokens and security**

{% hint style="warning" %}
We recommend learning how to set up the API Connector in a secure way. If you want to learn more about this, check out our dedicated article on API Connector security.

Article: [API Connector security](../../security/api-security)
{% endhint %}

If you are new to APIs it’s important to emphasize here the importance of keeping your API token **secret**. API tokens in principle serve the same function as a username and password, but they add security and flexibility that is useful to an API provider:

1. They can be easily generated and revoked: Unlike a username and password, which are typically created and managed by an actual person, API tokens can be easily generated and revoked by the API provider. This makes it easy to control access to the API and limit the impact of any security breaches.
2. They are more secure: API tokens are generally more secure than username and password combinations, because they are typically harder to guess or brute force. They can also be rotated regularly to further improve security.
3. They are more convenient: API tokens are generally easier for developers to work with than username and password combinations, because they do not require any special handling. This can make it easier for developers to use your API and can increase adoption of your API.

Just like a username and password, a token is only as secure as the one who manages it. Tokens to important services like Stripe should be handled with the utmost confidentiality.

{% hint style="danger" %}
API keys/tokens should never be stored in Option Sets or in on-page elements and/or workflows, since that makes them visible in your application’s client-side source code.
{% endhint %}

## Shared headers

Sometimes you'll need to add the same header to all your calls. This can be related to authentication, but it doesn't have to be. Another typical key and value included in the header section is the _content-type,_ which specifies the expected format of the call.

Consult the external API documentation to see if they require any specific headers.

## Shared parameters

Shared parameters, like the headers described above, will be added to each and every call in the relevant API. Shared parameters are added to the _body_ of the request rather than the header.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
It doesn't make any technical difference whether you add _headers_ and _parameters_ directly to each call or use the _Shared headers/parameters feature_.\
\
Adding them to this section will simply save you some time and make the headers and parameters easier to set up and manage.
{% endhint %}

## **Adding calls**

Now that we have 1) given our API service a descriptive name and 2) authenticated as a client (if necessary) it’s time to add the actual calls.

<figure><img src="https://34394582-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FbVIX65t8fVUgzIN6dJQ9%2Fadd-call-api-connector.png?alt=media&#x26;token=085ddf94-e3e4-4d1a-882c-690b3f7300e7" alt=""><figcaption><p>To add a call, click the <em>Add another call</em> button</p></figcaption></figure>

Again we need to name the call before doing anything else. Give it a descriptive name that can be combined with the name you gave earlier to the API provider. For example, you might name the API Provider Stripe and the API Call Create payment.

Secondly, we need to tell Bubble what this call will be used for in the Use as dropdown.

### Use as

The _Use as_ dropdown lets you select whether to use that particular API call as a data source or an action:

#### Data

Use as data means that Bubble will treat the API call as a data source. Use this for calls that you set up to retrieve data that you want to display in your app. You will find API data sources in the Get data from external API in the dropdown list of data sources.

<figure><img src="https://34394582-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FCQsQyzv6tRJN97osw0cB%2Fget-data-external-api%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=69a962e6-283e-4ac9-90aa-c03c4ad76be4" alt=""><figcaption><p>Setting the API call to be of type <strong>Data</strong> allows you to use the call as a data source. That way you can use it to populate Repeating Group for example.</p></figcaption></figure>

#### Action

Use as action makes the API call available as an action in your Workflow editor. You will find API action calls in the workflow editor under Plugins.&#x20;

<figure><img src="https://34394582-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FkROoSioQn77ihqEDSPRI%2Frun-api-call-as-action-bubbl%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=2c6d9a35-6e4f-4377-b574-3412d2c45bc3" alt=""><figcaption><p>Setting an API call to type <strong>Action</strong> lets you run that call from a workflow in your application. The label (RentalSoftware - Create Unit) is a combination of the name you gave the API provider and the name of the call in the API Connector.</p></figcaption></figure>

### **The HTTP method**

When a call is made to a specific resource[^10], we need to specify an [HTTP method](#user-content-fn-11)[^11] that tells the server what kind of action we want to initiate. The five most used HTTP methods are:

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="134"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Action</strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td></tr><tr><td>GET</td><td>Retrieve data</td></tr><tr><td>POST</td><td>Create data</td></tr><tr><td>PUT</td><td>Update data</td></tr><tr><td>PATCH</td><td>Replace data</td></tr><tr><td>DELETE</td><td>Delete data</td></tr></tbody></table>

\
HTTP methods are sometimes called _HTTP verbs_. Generally they are used as illustrated in the table above, but to find the correct HTTP method for the resource you want to access, check the API providers documentation.

<figure><img src="https://34394582-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2FQX2wWdVVneNsxvrVgNsQ%2Fbubble-http-method.png?alt=media&#x26;token=9f69caf7-09b1-4a14-885f-4db189a1f6d9" alt=""><figcaption><p>Setting the HTTP method in the dropdown in red tells the external app what kind of action you want to take. GET usually means you want to return data.</p></figcaption></figure>

### **The URL and endpoint**

In our [general article on APIs](introduction-to-apis) we explored how a [RESTful API](#user-content-fn-12)[^12] call uses a URL to identify a specific resource.

For example, when we were looking at Bubble’s [Data API](#user-content-fn-13)[^13] (used to give external systems access to the database) and [Workflow API](#user-content-fn-14)[^14] (used to give external systems access to workflows) we looked at how Bubble generates a unique URL for each data type you choose to expose in the Data API and each API Workflow you choose to expose in the backend workflow editor.

External RESTful APIs work in the same way: you direct your Bubble application to a specific URL in order to reach the resource that you want. Together, the HTTP method and the endpoint form a unique API endpoint that defines the specific action that is being requested.

For example, a GET request to a "/users" endpoint might be used to retrieve a list of users from an API, while a POST request to the "/users" endpoint might be used to create a new user.

<figure><img src="https://34394582-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-M5sbzwG7CljeZdkntrL%2Fuploads%2F5Y49MTVcEAjDZ7RMc9pI%2Fapi-endpoint%402x.png?alt=media&#x26;token=2da6d871-c819-4d84-85d5-d52d0acf13b8" alt=""><figcaption><p>In the example above, we have found the correct endpoint to translate a text using the Google Cloud Translation API. The documentation also </p></figcaption></figure>

#### Finding the correct endpoint

The endpoint is the combination of the HTTP method and the URL (resource locator). What method to use and what the URL is differs between different API services, and you can usually find the correct endpoint by consulting the documentation of the API provider.

## Initializing a call

{% hint style="warning" %}
When you initialize a call, keep in mind that Bubble sends an actual call to the server, potentially loading and manipulating data.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
The test data that you enter in the _value_ field of a parameter, is visible in your app's code unless the _Private_ box is ticked. You should remove any sensitive data from this field before you deploy.
{% endhint %}

When a call is set up, it needs to be initialized. This means to run the call to test it. This is a required step before the call can be used in your app, for a few reasons:

* It informs us about the **success or failure** of the call.
* It furnishes us with a response that **outlines the JSON data format**. This enables Bubble to establish the call as a data source, as it understands its organization.
  * You can also have a look at the data (structured or raw) that the server returns, to verify that it gives the expected results, and to understand its structure

When you click the _Initialize a call_ button, Bubble sends the call to the server, and displays the response in a popup. If the call is unsuccessful, the API Connector will show you the relevant error message.

### Raw body text

{% hint style="info" %}
_Raw body text_ is an experimental feature. Currently, it is only accessible via the API connector when the _include errors_ or _include headers_ checkbox is clicked.

Also, it is not available if you use a nested field in a dynamic expressions, such as `first items's raw body text`.
{% endhint %}

You can also view the raw body text returned by the server. This refers to the unprocessed information received from the API endpoint.&#x20;

Raw data provides the foundational information that can then be parsed, manipulated, or displayed as needed within your app. It forms the basis for further processing and integration within the app's actions and data sources.

<summary>Authentication and authorization</summary>

**Authentication** is the process of verifying the identity of a client sending an API request (**who** the client is). For example, the Bubble API can be set up to require a bearer token to prove the identity of the client trying to connect. This process of providing the credentials and the server verifies them is the authentication process.\
\
**Authorization** is the process of determining **what** a client has access to after they have authenticated themselves. It is the mechanism by which an API can determine what a user or system is allowed to do once they have been authenticated. For example, after a client has authenticated themselves with the Bubble API, the API will check your app's Privacy API settings, privacy rules and other details to determine whether they have access to specific [resources](#resource).

**In short:** Authentication is the process of verifying **who** you are, while authorization is the process of verifying **what** you have access to.

<summary>API</summary>

API stands for _Application Programming Interface_ and it is a set of protocols, routines, and tools for allowing different software systems to communicate with each other.

Imagine you're at a restaurant. You, the customer, want to order food, but you don't go into the kitchen yourself. Instead, you give your order to a waiter. The waiter then goes to the kitchen, gets your food, and brings it back to you.

In this scenario, the kitchen is like an external app or system (the server). You, wanting to get some data or service from this system, are the client. The waiter is like the API.

Just as the waiter takes your order to the kitchen and brings back your food, the API takes requests from one app (the client) to another (the server) and returns the needed response.

**Examples:**

1. **Data Retrieval:** Fetching data from a remote database, like getting weather updates from a weather service.
2. **Integration:** Connecting to different services, like integrating a payment gateway (e.g., PayPal or Stripe) into your app.
3. **Automation:** Performing tasks in other systems, like posting a social media post to LinkedIn or creating an appointment in Google Calendar.
4. **Enrichment:** Enhancing functionalities, like using a map API to display locations in your app.
5. **Authentication:** Verifying user identity and granting access using an authentication system like OAuth to log into your app through Google or Facebook credentials.

<details>

<summary>Client/Server</summary>

In the context of an API call, the **Client** is the one that initiates the call and the **server** is the one to respond.\
\
In the case of an **incoming** API request (The Data API or Workflow API) the system sending the request is the **client** and the Bubble server that hosts your app is the **server.**\
\
In the case of **outgoing** API request (The API Connector) your Bubble app is the **client** and the system you are connecting with is the **server**.\
\
**Other ways to learn:**\

</details>

<details>

<summary>Endpoint</summary>

An endpoint is a specific URL that an application can send requests to, to retrieve or manipulate data.\
\
In the Bubble API, the endpoint is the URL that identifies a **data type** or a specific **API Workflow.** In outgoing requests made via the API Connector, the endpoint is the HTTP action and URL that you are pointing the call towards.\
\

</details>

<details>

<summary>HTTP Method / HTTP Verb</summary>

The HTTP method is the instruction for the server to indicate the desired action to be performed on the specified [resource](#resource) (e.g. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

* **GET:** Retrieves data from a server\
  (like viewing a webpage or getting a weather update).
* **POST:** Sends data to a server to create a new resource\
  (like adding a new calendar appointment to Google Calendar).
* **PUT:** Updates an existing resource with new data\
  (like changing the date of a calendar appointment in Google Calendar).
* **DELETE:** Removes a resource from the server.\
  (like deleting an appointment in Google Calendar)

<summary>HTTP protocol</summary>

The HTTP protocol is the blueprint for how most data is exchanged between a client and a server. It defines how a request and response is formatted, so both systems understand each other.

<details>

<summary>JSON</summary>

JSON is a lightweight data interchange format typically used in Javascript. It uses human-readable text to transmit data objects that consist of attribute–value pairs and array data types.\
\
It is commonly used both in incoming API Connections (the Data API and Workflow API) and outgoing API Connections (The API Connector).

#### **Example**

Below is an example of what JSON code may look like. In this example we're storing data about a user, and as you can see, it's easily readable both by humans and computers:

`{`

`"user": {`

&#x20;  `"id": "123456",`\
&#x20;  `"username": "johnDoe123",`\
&#x20;  `"email": "johndoe@email.com",`\
&#x20;  `"firstName": "John",`\
&#x20;  `"lastName": "Doe",`\
&#x20;  `"birthdate": "1990-01-01",`\
&#x20;  `"profilePictureUrl": "https://example.com/profiles/johnDoe123.jpg",`\
&#x20;  `"phone": "555-1234",`\
&#x20;  `"joinedDate": "2022-04-20"`

&#x20;  `}`

`}`\

<details>

<summary>Key-value pair</summary>

A key-value pair is a basic data structure where a 'key' (a unique identifier) is linked to a 'value' (the data). It's used in many programming languages, and in Bubble you can often come across it when you work with the [API Connector](#user-content-fn-1)[^1].

For example, in the [JSON](#json) code below, the text marked in bold are two key-value pairs:

* Key: "id" - value: "123456"
* Key: "username" - value: "johnDoe123"

`{`

`"user": {`

&#x20;  **`"id": "123456",`**\
&#x20;  **`"username": "johnDoe123",`**

&#x20;  `}`

`}`

</details>

<details>

<summary>Oauth2</summary>

OAuth2 is a protocol used by a server to determine a client's authorization. It lets a User grant an app (like your Bubble app) access to the resources stored in an external app without having to share their login credentials with the first app.\
\
Instead, the server that hosts the external app will issue a token that your app can use to access the User's resources. That way, subsequent requests can be made without the User having to authorize each one or share their credentials.\
\
**Examples:**

* A User wants to connect their social media account (such as Facebook or Twitter) to your Bubble-built social media management app in order to share posts automatically. The User grants your app access to their social media account using OAuth2, and your app is issued a token that it can use to post photos on behalf of the User.

- A User wants to be able to automatically add appoints to Google Calendar when a meeting is booked in your Bubble-built CRM. The User grants your app access to their Google account your app is issued a token that lets your app make changes to the User's calendar as needed.

* An enterprise clients wants to allow your app to access resources from their server without giving them actual login credentials. They use OAuth2 to issue a token to your app that you can use for subsequent calls.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Object / JSON Object</summary>

A JSON object is a way to structure data in a way that both computers and humans can easily understand. An object can consist of multiple **keys**, and each key has a **value**. This is often called a key-value pair.

In Bubble, consider the _User_ data type as an example. When you examine a User in Bubble, you'll notice it consists of various built-in and custom fields like email, name, and phone number. These fields act as keys in a key-value pair, and the specific information for each user (their actual email address, name, and phone number) represents the values.&#x20;

In JSON, a user object may look something like this:

`{`\
&#x20; `"user": {`\
&#x20;    `"first_name": "Ana",`\
&#x20;    `"last_name": "Silva",`\
&#x20;    `"email": "ana.silva@example.com"`\
&#x20; `}`\
`}`

As you can see, this is perfectly readable for a human, but the consistent structure also means computers can easily read it. The similarity to Bubble is not a coincidence – in fact, Bubble downloads data to the page in a JSON structure. This is why Bubble communicates with other apps and systems so easily – because JSON is a widely used format.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Payload</summary>

The payload refers to the data sent with the request. Depending on the [HTTP method](#http-method) used, the payload can be part of the request body (as in a POST, PUT, or PATCH request) or within the URL itself (as in a GET request with query parameters).

For most API interactions that involve the transmission of data (like creating a new user or updating a record), the payload carries the necessary information.

#### **Example:**

Imagine you're creating a new user in a system using an API. The API documentation specifies that the endpoint expects data like a username, email, and password. The payload for this API call might look something like this:

`{`

&#x20;  `"username": "johnDoe123",`\
&#x20;  `"email": "johndoe@email.com",`\
&#x20;  `"password": "securePassword123"`

`}`

In this example, the [JSON](#json) structure containing the username, email, and password is the payload. When making a POST request to the API endpoint, this payload would be included in the body of the request. The API server processes this payload and performs the necessary actions, such as creating the user in the database.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Resource</summary>

A resource is a specific data object or service that is made available by an API and can be accessed via a unique endpoint using methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.\
\
For example, if you are trying to access data about a specific User in your Bubble app from an external application, the _User_ endpoint can be considered a resource. The same can be said about a specific API Workflow.\
\
In other words, a resource represents a specific piece of information or functionality that an API can provide.\

Article: [What is a RESTful API?](introduction-to-apis/what-is-a-restful-api)

</details>

<details>

<summary>Request/Response</summary>

In an API call, the **request** is the data sent from the client to initiate the connection. It contains all the data needed to authenticate and instruct the server what the request is about.\
\
The **response** is the data sent back from the server to the client in response to the request.\
\

<details>

<summary>RESTful</summary>

APIs that are RESTful mean that they are built on a set of architectural principles for building web services known as _Representational State Transfer (REST)_. Most commercial and public API services adhere to these principles.\
\
In short, this is a way to ensure that APIs that communicate with each other are compatible, or "speak the same language" if you will. Bubble's API and the API Connector is built around RESTful principles, which means it can connect to almost any web API.\
\
**Other ways to learn:**

Article: [What is a RESTful API?](introduction-to-apis/what-is-a-restful-api)

</details>

<details>

<summary>Token</summary>

A token is a string that identifies the client sending an API request.\
\
In the case of **incoming** requests (The Data API or Workflow API) the token is issued by Bubble.\
\
In the case of **outgoing** requests (The API Connector) the token is issued by the server you are connecting to.

#### How are tokens different from username/password?

A token is a unique, randomly generated string that confirms a user's session or authorization, usually given _after_ the first login. It lets users access services without constantly inputting their username/password, enhancing security.

Think of it like this: If a user logs into your app using Facebook, they don't hand over their Facebook login details to your app. Instead, Facebook verifies their login and hands your app a token as proof. A key advantage is that tokens can be swiftly revoked, making them more secure and flexible compared to the traditional username/password method, which can be tedious to alter.\

## Public API endpoints

### Enable Workflow API and backend workflows

Check this box if you want the app to expose an API that you or other developers/services can access to run API workflows. In addition to API workflows (which can be used for scheduled workflows), there are two other types of backend workflows: recurring events and database change trigger events. Unchecking this box will disable the API endpoint. It will not stop backend workflows from running. You can pause the scheduler in the Logs tab to stop these workflows from running.

### Enable Data API

Check this box if you want the app to expose an API that you or other developers/services can access to read or write the app data directly. When checked, select which types to expose as an API in the options that display.

### Use field display instead of ID for key names

GET API calls or Return Data actions can either return data with the keys being a fixed ID or use the display defined for the field in the Data Types section in the Data Tab. Choose this setting here.

### Hide Swagger API documentation access

Check this box if you want the app to hide the automatically generated Swagger API documentation that you or other developers/services can access. See the [Swagger Specification](../../../help-guides/integrations/api/the-bubble-api#swagger-specification) section for more details.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Warning

Hiding this may break some Bubble App Connector features.
{% endhint %}

## 3rd Party OAuth / SAML Access

If the app exposes an OAuth2 protocol, meaning users can log in to other websites using their credentials with the app, you must define the page they get redirected to once they authenticate. Select the page here.

* When your Bubble app is used as an OAuth provider, a GET call is made to:\
  \
  `https://[Your-App- URL]/version-test/api/1.1/oauth/authorize`\
  \
  with the client\_id and redirect\_uri as parameters.
* When this is successful, a parameter, "code", is sent back in the URL, to the external service
* Next, the external service must execute a POST call to:\
  \
  `https://[Your-App-URL]/version- test/api/1.1/oauth/access_token`\
  \
  with parameters: "client\_id", "client\_secret", "redirect\_uri", and "code". This is known as the token endpoint.
* Lastly, the app will respond with "access\_token", "expires\_in", and "uid" parameters that the external site can store for the user.
  * The access\_token is used in future calls to the Bubble app from the user within the external app (until expiry)
* Refreshing the token: In the POST body, set grant\_type to "refresh\_code" and send the refresh token as the refresh\_token received previously. You will need to include the same client\_id and client\_secret used when getting the token in the first place.

## Discourse SSO

For apps on the Professional plan and above, the Bubble app can be used as a single sign-on (SSO) provider for a Discourse forum.&#x20;

For more information and set-up instructions on the Discourse side, please see [this article](https://meta.discourse.org/t/discourseconnect-official-single-sign-on-for-discourse-sso/13045).

### Discourse base URL

This is the URL for your Discourse forum, where you want your app's end-users to be able to log into with their app username and password.

### Discourse SSO secret

This is a token generated from Discourse.

### Suppress welcome message flag

If this checkbox is not checked, any user logging in via your app into your Discourse forum will receive Discourse's welcome email.

### Require activation flag

Checking this setting will have Discourse send email verification emails to any user who creates an account via SSO. This is generally recommended by Discourse.

### Default avatar when creating the account

If this is set, all new users created via SSO in your Discourse forum will have this image as their initial avatar.

## Advanced

### Download public JSON web key

Certain custom integrations with other web services will require the "public JSON web key" of your Bubble app. This is where you can download it.

**Multiple browser tabs editing the same app**

Opening the Bubble editor for the same app in multiple browser tabs might result in unexpected behavior. We recommend keeping the editor of an app limited to just one tab at a time.
{% endhint %}

The Bubble editor is like a digital workshop where you build and design your app. Think of it as a crafting table where you arrange, tweak, and connect different parts to make your app look and work just the way you want.

We will go into the technical details of design, data and logic in later chapters, but for now we'll cover how the editor is structured, and the different tools available.
