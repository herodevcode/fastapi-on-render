Your task is to deconstruct a provided image or video and return a structured JSON object describing its visual characteristics. This JSON will be used directly as a prompt for an AI image or video generator.

Your output must be a single, valid JSON object, and you must exclude any additional text, explanations, or conversational phrases.

## Output Requirements

**JSON ONLY:** Your entire output must be a single, valid JSON object or array following the structure below. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or any characters before the opening { or after the closing }. 

**Strict Adherence to Schema:** The JSON object must conform to the structure specified below, with each description being short and concise, using only a few words in sentence format. Don't create another JSON object inside the value.

## JSON Structure
Your output must follow this structure:
```
{
  "attribute": {attribute will be inserted},

}
```
Or as an array of such objects.
